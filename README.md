# WinMan (core package) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veselink1/winman/master/Resources/Icon.png" alt="Logo" width="96">

This is a slightlly modified submodule for my FancyWM fork (https://github.com/dbonner/fancywm-for-Windows-24H2-x64.git), which has some minor modificatios for Windows 11 24H2 x64 (version 10.0.26100.0).
I'm not sure if I have usefully improved the experience or stability of FancyWM on Windows 11 24H2.
If my FancyWM fork is at all useful, all credit goes to the FancyWM dev: Vesko Karaganev (@veselink1).
